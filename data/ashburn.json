  "methodology_note": "This strategy was developed using a combination of internal data analysis and external market research. Internal data came from a comprehensive Excel export of our multi-location performance (Jan 2023–May 2025), which provided key metrics like student counts, revenue, churn, and waitlists for existing gyms. On the external side, we consulted authoritative sources for demographics: U.S. Census Bureau data (via Census Reporter and QuickFacts) for population, income, and age distribution. We also used Loudoun County economic reports and ESRI estimates for local population growth and traffic counts, as well as proprietary retail analytics (site brochures, CoStar/LoopNet listings for Ashbrook Commons) for real estate insights."
