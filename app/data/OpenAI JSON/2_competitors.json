                "finding": "Most structured programs cluster around $100–$160 per month for a weekly class (e.g. dance, martial arts, Little Gym). Hope and G-Force likely charge ~$150 for gymnastics classes, similar to DDGA’s base rate ($148/mo). Martial arts studios differentiate by family pricing (effectively lowering per-person cost for multi-kid families). Always In Motion undercuts with $96 for one class/week but offers an unlimited plan at $140.",
                "conclusion": "DDGA Ashburn can comfortably set its base membership around $148/month to align with the top end of the market and its premium brand, while leveraging strategic discounts (sibling, trial classes) to remain competitive."

            {
                "topic": "Program Mix",
                "finding": "DDGA’s broad mix (recreational gymnastics, Ninja classes, preschool, etc.) is unique among competitors. G-Force comes closest with gymnastics + ninja, but most are specialized (dance-only, karate-only, indoor play).",
                "conclusion": "Positioning DDGA as a one-stop solution encourages multi-program participation and cross-segment revenue, supported by a 10% multi-class discount."

                "finding": "Competitors highlight quality aspects (professional dance training, life-skills curriculum, competitive team legacy).",
                "conclusion": "DDGA’s Olympian founder and mission of “confidence & character” in a non-pressured environment should be central to marketing to differentiate from purely local names."

            {
                "topic": "Market Saturation",
                "finding": "Within 5 miles, families have at least three gymnastics options plus multiple martial arts and dance studios. Many classes have waitlists.",
                "conclusion": "While competition is strong, rapid population growth and unmet demand create room for DDGA. An accelerated marketing effort and differentiation will attract new and existing families."
