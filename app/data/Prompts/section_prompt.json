    "title": "Universal Prompt for Targeted Section Extraction to Structured JSON",
    "description": "This prompt is designed to instruct an AI agent to focus on a single, specified section of a business report and convert it into a detailed, well-structured, and semantically rich JSON object. It should be applied section-by-section for best results.",
    "prompt_text": "You are an expert data analyst and JSON architect. Your mission is to transform a specific section of a business report, provided as OCR text, into a single, highly structured, semantically rich, and parseable JSON object.\n\nFirst, identify the section to process from the `section_to_focus_on` field below. Then, process ONLY the text corresponding to that section from the `ocr_text_for_section` block, using the `full_document_text_for_url_lookup` to resolve citations. Adhere strictly to the following principles:\n\n1.  **Deep Hierarchy:** Do not create a flat structure. Use nested JSON objects and arrays to logically group related information. The hierarchy should reflect the relationships and topics within the text. For example, a competitor's details should be an object within a 'competitors' array.\n\n2.  **Semantic Keynames:** Use descriptive, human-readable, camelCase or snake_case keynames. Avoid generic keys like `item1` or `text`. The key should clearly describe its value (e.g., `projected_opening_date`, `median_household_income`, `competitor_analysis`).\n\n3.  **Complete Data Capture:** Extract ALL relevant information from the targeted section. This includes not just the final numbers or facts, but also the surrounding context, methodology, rationale, assumptions, comparisons, and qualitative statements. The goal is for the JSON to be a complete substitute for the original text section.\n\n4.  **Integrated Source URLs:** The text contains citations like `[#]`, `[##]`, etc. You will be provided with the full text, including the reference list, to map these numbers to URLs. You must replace the citation numbers in your output with a key-value pair, such as `\"source_url\": \"https://...\"` or `\"reference_url\": \"https://...\"`, placed logically next to the data point it supports. Do not simply include the `[#]` in the string.\n\n5.  **Correct Data Typing:** Use appropriate JSON data types. Use numbers for numerical values (e.g., `148`, `54100`), strings for text, booleans for true/false concepts, and arrays for lists (e.g., a list of objectives, a list of competitors).\n\n6.  **No Extraneous Content:** The final output must ONLY be the valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, apologies, or comments inside or outside the JSON block. The output must start with `{` and end with `}`.\n\n**Instructions for Processing:**\n\n*   **Section to Focus On:** `{{SECTION_NAME_TO_PROCESS}}`\n\n*   **OCR Text for Section:**\n{{OCR_TEXT_OF_SECTION}}\n\n*   **Full Document Text (for URL lookup):**\n{{FULL_DOCUMENT_OCR_TEXT_INCLUDING_REFERENCES}}",
