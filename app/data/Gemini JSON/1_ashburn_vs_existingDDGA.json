Weights for each factor (in parentheses) were chosen based on expected impact on gym performance: child population (25%), affluence (20%), lease economics (15%), competition (15%), suburban density (15%), school calendar alignment (10%). A weighted Euclidean distance was calculated then converted to a 0–100 similarity index (methodology footnoted).",

Columbia has comparable demographics to Ashburn but its Maryland location has a later school start and some lower-income adjacent areas, plus a smaller facility size, yielding a similarity of 79. Overall, Ashburn sits between Rockville and Columbia in market profile: a high-income suburban family area with strong demand (lots of kids) but also plenty of alternatives in close proximity. This informed our ramp assumptions and competitive pricing strategy – we expect Ashburn to acquire members more like Rockville (fast uptake, but also needing differentiation due to competition) rather than Clarksburg (which enjoyed a captive market)."
