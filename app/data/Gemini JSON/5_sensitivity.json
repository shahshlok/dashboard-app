These address how swings in membership count or pricing power, and changes in retention (churn) or wage rates, affect the bottom line. The results are presented as heatmaps in Tables 5 and 6.",

We use a simplified steady-state assumption (once the gym is at capacity, ignoring ramp time). For instance, base case steady-state was ~400 students @ $148/mo yielding a tiny profit ~0. At 400 students, if we could increase average price to $163 (10% hike) without losing members, the profit margin jumps significantly. Conversely, if enrollment is only 300 and price is $140, we incur losses. Table 5 shows the annual EBITDA outcome at different combinations (for context, 400@$148 is roughly breakeven, matching our model's Year 1 outcome).",

Retention affects how much marketing and sales effort (and cost) we need to maintain and grow enrollment – poor retention means constantly “refilling a leaky bucket.” Instructor cost is a key variable expense; labor market tightness or need for higher pay to attract quality coaches could raise this. We looked at a representative steady-state scenario (say ~400 students, ~$50k monthly revenue) and calculated the monthly EBITDA under combinations of retention (85%, 90%, 95%) and avg coach wage ($18, $22, $26 hourly, roughly corresponding to $20k, $25k, $30k annual for part-time coaches).

Higher coach pay (every ~$4/hr ~ +$1.5k/month in wages) reduces EBITDA. E.g. going from 90% to 85% retention drops profit by ~$2k (due to extra ~20 student acquisitions needed * $100 CAC), while going from $22 to $26/hr pay drops profit ~$1.5k. Combined worst case (85% & $26) yields only ~$1k profit; best (95% & $18) yields ~$8k. Base case (90% & $22) is ~$5k, consistent with breakeven-ish at 400 students.)"

Specifically, at 400 students, 90% retention means 40 churn/month; 95% means only 20 churn – saving ~20 * CAC($100) = $2k in marketing, which flows to profit. Conversely, dropping to 85% retention (60 churn) would cost an extra ~$2k in marketing, eroding profit.",
