This strategy, combined with diligent cost control and a focus on retention, positions the gym to maximize lifetime value (each happy family could stay for years, maybe spending on classes, camps, parties – far exceeding any one-time discounts given). As our financial projections indicate, achieving strong retention and full classes will yield a healthy profit even at these prices, fulfilling our mission objectives."
