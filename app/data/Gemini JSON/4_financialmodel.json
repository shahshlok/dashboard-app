All scenarios are built from common structural assumptions, with specific key deltas (enrollment ramp speed, pricing realization, and retention/churn differences). Table 3 below shows the Base Case P&L and Cash Flow month-by-month, followed by descriptions of line items and scenario adjustments. All calculations are traceable via footnotes or tables.",

We also assume in this case that we realize a bit less revenue per student (say $140 average, if we have to give promo discounts or more young kids join) and retention is 85% (slightly higher churn). This scenario might also include maintaining higher marketing spend for longer (e.g. $5k/month through spring to try to boost numbers).",

Sensitivity analysis (Section 6.3) further explores the impact of price and retention on these outcomes."
